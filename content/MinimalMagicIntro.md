[I](https://minimalmagic.blog/pumwalters/  "Pum Walters") once gave a freshman course on system engineering. [The magic of system engineering](https://minimalmagic.blog/se/themagicofsystemengineering/ "The magic of system engineering.md") is that once you understand a transistor, you can mostly understand an entire CPU. Later, I started writing a book on term rewriting with a similar foundation: *Ex Principiis Omnia*. This gave me the idea to start a blog with work and musings on that underlying theme.
