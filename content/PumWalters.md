I am an independent researcher in Computer Science (Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Enterprise Architecture, and Technical Computing). I have written various articles on Computer Science & Education and many parts of *as-yet* unpublished books and stories (both science and fiction). 

Over the years, I've had many ideas for papers or books, and I only just now realized they often share a common theme, which is the reason to create this blog and which is expressed in the motto ***Ex Principiis Omnia***: everything follows from the beginning with **minimal magic**.
